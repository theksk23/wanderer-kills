defmodule WandererKills.Ingest.Killmails.CharacterMatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Utilities for matching characters in killmails against subscription filters.

  This module provides functions to check if a killmail contains specific
  character IDs either as victims or attackers, supporting the character-based
  subscription filtering feature.

  ## Performance Characteristics

  - Uses MapSet for O(1) character ID lookups
  - Short-circuits on victim match before checking attackers
  - Handles large attacker lists efficiently
  - Includes telemetry for performance monitoring

  ## Telemetry Events

  Emits `[:wanderer_kills, :character, :match]` events with:
  - `duration` - Matching duration in native time units
  - `match_found` - 1 if match found, 0 otherwise
  - `character_count` - Number of characters being matched against

  ## Usage in Subscriptions

  This module is primarily used by the `WandererKills.Subs.Subscriptions.Filter`
  module to determine if killmails should be delivered to character-based
  subscriptions.

  Checks if a killmail contains any of the specified character IDs.

  Returns true if the killmail's victim or any attacker matches one of the
  provided character IDs.

  ## Parameters
    - `killmail` - The killmail data structure (map)
    - `character_ids` - List of character IDs to match against

  ## Returns
    - `true` if any character ID matches
    - `false` if no matches found

  ## Examples
      iex> killmail = %{"victim" => %{"character_id" => 123}, "attackers" => []}
      iex> CharacterMatcher.killmail_has_characters?(killmail, [123, 456])

  Extracts all unique character IDs from a killmail.

  Returns a list of all character IDs found in the killmail, including

  ## Returns
    - List of unique character IDs (integers)
